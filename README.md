## Overview

This project leverages AWS services to analyze Spotify data. The data is stored in S3, processed with AWS Glue, queried using Athena, and visualized with QuickSight. The project provides a robust pipeline for handling and analyzing large datasets, making it easier to gain insights from Spotify data.

## Features

- Store and manage data using Amazon S3
- Use AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- Query data with Amazon Athena
- Visualize data with Amazon QuickSight
- Manage access with AWS IAM

## Tech Stack

- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for storing Spotify data.
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management for secure access to AWS services.
- **AWS Glue**: ETL service for transforming and loading data.
- **Amazon Athena**: Interactive query service to analyze data in S3.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Business intelligence service for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
